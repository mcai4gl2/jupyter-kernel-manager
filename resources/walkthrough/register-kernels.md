## Register as Jupyter Kernels

After setup, run **"Register All Kernels"** to make them available in the Jupyter kernel picker.

Each kernel is registered as a Jupyter kernelspec (e.g., `py-learn-data_science`) so you can select it when opening notebooks.

With **Auto Register** enabled (default), kernels are automatically registered after setup — no extra step needed.

The kernel prefix (default: `py-learn`) can be customized in settings.
