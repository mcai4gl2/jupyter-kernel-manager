## Open a Notebook

You're all set! Open any `.ipynb` file and select your kernel from the kernel picker in the top-right corner of the notebook editor.

Your managed kernels will appear with the prefix you configured (e.g., `py-learn-data_science`).

### Useful commands

- **Check Kernel Health** — run diagnostics to troubleshoot issues
- **Update Notebook Kernels** — batch-update kernel metadata across notebooks
- **Open Kernel Shell** — open a terminal with the venv activated
- **Add New Kernel** — wizard to add a new kernel definition

All commands are available from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) under "Jupyter Kernel Manager".
